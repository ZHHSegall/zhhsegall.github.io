title: "Reconstructed 2019 Resolutions and 2018 Review"
date: 2019-12-09

I started writing about my reflections for 2018 and resolutions for 2019 at the end of 2018 and just.
kept. procrastinating. The writing slipped from New Years to Chinese New Years to mid-year to now,
when I’m writing my 2019 reflections and 2020 resolutions. But it feels wrong to write the new set of resolutions
without finishing the old. Fortunately, I took good enough notes that I can do a passable reconstruction of
where I was at. So here are my reconstructed reflections for 2018 and resolutions for 2019.

I decided not to renew my 2018 resolutions in 2019 for one simple reason: I didn’t use them.
I still pursued them, but only because most of them are goals I think of as worthwhile in the moment.
Setting goals did nothing to help achieve more and it didn’t really shift how I made my choices.
What they did help me do is reflect on the distance I traveled. So instead of writing resolutions
that I won’t think about for a year, I’m going to write about big open questions, what skills I want to develop,
and what I’m happy with, many of which will be direct extensions of the goals I had for 2018.

The 2018 Retrospective:

1. **Start maintaining a personal website**: Still an utter failure. I continued to make no changes to
   my website and completely forgot to even think about recording major life events. I also still think
   that it would be cool if I logged major life events on my website, and that I should probably keep my
   status information up to date.
2. **Exercise for a half hour each morning**: This fell apart sometime in the spring. I think my exercise routine
   got too stagnant, and I just didn’t care about it any more. I’m currently looking into finding ways of making
   exercising more compelling by setting tangible goals I can test myself against, such as the ability to kick over
   my head like I did when I practiced karate regularly. I’m also trying to figure out what I want out of my exercise
   habits on a lifetime scale.
3. **Cut down on sugar**: Variably successful? I literally cannot drink soda any more, it hecks up my body too much.
   My sugar limit before I start feeling absolutely awful is somewhere around two donuts. The biggest hurdle
   I’m facing now is my environment: I encounter sweets at least once a week, and my instinct to take free stuff
   kicks in. I am also tempted into buying cheap ice cream by store deals and roommate shopping habits.
   I intend to attempt the sugar free month in April, for my birthday.
4. **Read 50 nonfiction books**: 84% successful. I read 42 nonfiction books. I’m discontinuing this goal in particular
   because I read books to learn and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not really absorbing what I read. With
   nothing like school forcing me to deeply process what I read, I don’t think about the books enough outside of
   the actual reading. In order to support my learning, I first need to find a better way of gauging my learning,
   which is another project I have slated for the year.
5. **Improve depth of flavor in my cooking**: Eh? I don’t think that my cooking has improved this year.
   I still want this to happen, I just don’t think I need to treat it as a resolution because of how intrinsically
   motivating not eating mediocre food is. Important changes this past year include realizing that most restaurant
   food is not that great either and starting to record what dishes I made along with my impressions of those dishes.
6. **Eat with someone new each week**: Fell apart in October-ish. The goal also morphed into meet with someone new
   each week, since the important part is the connections. This is another goal that’s started to feel artificial,
   much like exercise and food.

The 2019 Prospective:

Big, Open Questions
1. **What do I value, and how much am I willing to pay for it?** Primarily a monetary question,
   but also works with respect to time. Every time I am at a point where I can choose whether or
   not to buy something, I am unsure of how to make the choice and what the repercussions of my choices are.
   I mostly default to saying “yes,” saying “no” most often when I am worried I have overspent myself.
2. **What am I exercising towards?** A longer, healthier, and more energized life, obviously. But that is
   distant and nebulous from doing those X pushups today. And the push-ups seem rather arbitrary, in any case.
   I think I have a lot of reasons for this question, I just need to line them up and spin them into something salient.
3. **How to I measure learning?** I had a Read X Books goal for the past couple of years, but then my ambitions
   started trending more towards reading books than to learning. I’ve considered taking more notes, but I don’t
   find note-taking an entirely satisfactory answer. While I certainly think it would help learning, it doesn’t
   give me a way to assess how much I’m learning or whether I can do things better. And in any case, my goal might
   end up focusing around taking notes instead of learning.
4. **What cause area do I want to get behind (for now)?** I’m preoccupied with being able to do good,
   and looking for a cause area and a reason to believe it’s a solid option. I’m haunted by the 10x problem:
   if I can be ten times as effective by choosing one area over another, I can achieve as much in a few years
   as I could in my entire career.
5. **How do I prioritize all of the incoming possibilities and information?** Every day there are emails that
   come in with new information, meetups I can attend, books to read, relationships to deepen and relationships
   to start. I’d like an overarching system of prioritization with enough structure to keep me pointed at what
   I’m doing next and enough slack to let me be flexible enough to snag unpredictable opportunities.

Skills to improve
1. **Cooking**: I love good food and am trying to hammer out patterns that will let me cook better.
2. **Writing**: I want to both get better at writing and use writing to drive forward my growth as a thinker and feeler.
3. **Putting myself in others’ shoes**: I feel like my ability to take on others’ perspectives is lacking.
   I’m not really sure how to move forward, but I know that developing this facet of emotional intelligence is vital.

Things I’m pretty happy with
1. **Sleep habits**: I think the limiting factor on my sleep habits is not the sleep habits themselves,
   but the rest of my life. As I fit more pieces into place, I expect to start sleeping at my full potential.
