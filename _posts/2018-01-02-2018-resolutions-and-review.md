title: "2018 Resolutions and Review"

This year, I want to review how I did on my old resolutions and
 renew them for the new year:
 1. **Start maintaining a personal website**: Total failure.
	I made no changes to my website since roughly a year ago.
	For the new year, I'll put a more specific set of expectations
	on this goal. I'd like to add blog posts when I see major life
	events (ex. graduation) and keep the status information of
	the website up to date. I expect something like 3 to 6 posts
	in the next year. I'd also like to spend some 10-20 hours at 
	some point in the year tinkering with HTML and improving the site. 
 2. **Exercise for a half hour each morning**: mostly successful.
	Although the time I exercised often fell more in the 15-20
	minute range, I exercised consistently, missing only a few 
	days each month. I noticed improvements in my physique since 
	last year. I would like to expand my exercise routine to
	incoporate more stretching, cardio, and meditation. 
 3. **Cut down on sugar**: Partially successful.
	I didn't cut down on deserts as much as I intended, nor did
	I attempt a sugar free month. However, I have effectively 
	removed soda from my diet and generally reduced the amount of
	sugar I consume. I've started to be more sensitive towards
	large quantities of sugar. By the end of the year, I'd
	like the only sugar I eat to come in the form of chocolate,
	baked goods, and fruit.
 4. **Read 50 books**: Completely successful.
	For next year, I want to read 50 *nonfiction* books or
	classic literature: 
	I discovered that I learn the most reading nonfiction.
	I'm sure I'll fit in some entertainment books around those.

Beyond renewing my existing goals, I do have a few more goals to add.
 5. **Improve depth of flavor in my cooking**: I've lived on my own
	and cooked enough to have basic competency around the kitchen.
	I've also done enough reading to know the fundamentals behind
	culinary theory. However, it seems like a lot of my dishes fall
	short of food that more experienced chefs or restaurants make. 
	I'd like to improve my ability to create richer and more complex 
	dishes. I imagine this will involve some combination of reading
	up on flavor profiles and practicing with a few new dishes 
	each month, and paying more careful attention to existing dishes.
 6. **Eat with someone new each week**: Leaving the safe bubble of college
	in May will result in me losing a lot of the socia network I've built
	up over the past three and a half years. Once I start my job,
	I'd like to make sure I keep making connections and branching out.
	To that end, once in Seattle, I want to eat with at least one
	new person each week I'm at my job.
