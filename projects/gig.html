	<span class="sapphire">The Motivation: </span> 
	Create an engaging game to teach German. Educational games often end up
	as uninspired wrappers for some piece of educational software. We aim to
	create a game that would be worth playing on its own merit, which also
	happens to teach German.

<p>
	<span class="sapphire"> The Game: </span> A genderless 
	alien has crash landed in Germany and needs to fix their ship 
	and get home, but is quite confused by the German language, 
	particularly all the gendered pronouns.
