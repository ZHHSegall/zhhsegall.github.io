title: Semi-Automated Program Synthesis
---
<p>
	Program synthesis is the process of generating a program from 
	specifications. Our approach is using a type 
	theory and proof search. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="sapphire">The Motivation: </span> Since our synthesizer uses enumeration
	of possible solutions, it experiences an exponential blow up in the search space as 
	program size increases. Implementing type theoretic restrictions helps reduce the search
	space, but the increase rate is still exponential.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="sapphire">The Research: </span>
	Our project is expanding the automated 
	<a href="https://github.com/psosera/myth">MYTH synthesizer</a>
	into a semi-automated synthesizer that allows the user to guide the
	synthesis process, reducing the search space with each choice
