title: Semi-Automated Program Synthesis
---
<p>
	Program synthesis is the process of generating a program from 
	specifications. Our approach is using a type 
	theory and proof search. 
	<br><br>
	<span class="sapphire">The Motivation: </span> The type theoretic model experiences 
	an exponential blow up in the search space. 
	<br><br>
	<span class="sapphire">The Research: </span>
	Our project is expanding the automated 
	<a href="https://github.com/psosera/myth">MYTH synthesizer</a>
	into a semi-automated synthesizer that allows the user to guide the
	synthesis process, reducing the search space with each choice
