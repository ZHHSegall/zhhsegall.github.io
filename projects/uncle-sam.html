title: Uncle Sam Plantation VR Experience 
---
<p>
	An educational project to create an open-source VR experience 
	(for Oculus and Rift) to teach about the history behind the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam_Plantation"> Uncle Sam Plantation </a> 
	in Lousiana. Sponsored by the
	<a href="http://gciel.sites.grinnell.edu">Grinnell College Immersive Experiences Lab (GCIEL)</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="sapphire">The Motivation: </span> 
	The original Uncle Sam plantation was demolished in 1940,
	but with VR we can reconstruct a museum-like experience
	to let current students explore the history behind the 
	plantation. VR offers other distinct advantages, namely
	it can give students a more physical sense of the plantation's
	scale while making the experience more accessible
	(no physical travel necessary).

<p>
	<span class="sapphire">The Project: </span> 
	The specifics have yet to be determined, but we intend to
	recreate buildings from the plantation and provide some
	form of historical guide through the experience, much like
	a museum tour. Doing so will involve creating digital
	recreations of the buildings, designing content for students
	to interact with, and implementing a way for students to
	progress through the experience.
