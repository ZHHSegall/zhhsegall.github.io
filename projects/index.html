		<h3 class="project-title"> Genderless in Germany </h3>
		<p> This is a research project in Spring 2017 to build a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel"> visual novel </a>
			that integrates a 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine"> game engine </a> 
			with an 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system"> intelligent tutoring system. </a>
			The motivation behind the project is to create a fun and engaging 
			game to teach German (educational games often fall short). 
			The premise is that the player is a genderless 
			alien who has crash landed in Germany and needs to fix their ship 
			and get home, but is quite confused by the German language, 
			particularly all the gendered pronouns. We will be developing the
			project in Unity. </p>

    	<h3 class="project-title"> Semi-Automated Program Synthesis </h3>
    	<p>
    		Program synthesis is the process of generating a program from 
    		specifications. One approach to synthesis is using a type 
    		theoretic approach and proof search. DifÔ¨Åculties with this 
    		synthesis model come from an exponential blow up in the search space. 
    		<br><br>
    		Our project is expanding the automated 
    		<a href="https://github.com/psosera/myth">MYTH synthesizer</a>
    		into a semi-automated synthesizer that allows the user to guide the
    		synthesis process, reducing the search space with each choice.

    	<p>
    		A weekly radio show where my co-host and I perform selected
    		pieces of fiction. KFic is a low time-intensive way for me
    		to stay practiced with spoken word performance.
